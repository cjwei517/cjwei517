ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cjwei517

I am a recent graduate from the National Taiwan University of Arts, 
currently dedicated to learning Unity game development, game planning, and coding. 
My background in the arts has ignited my passion for game development, 
as it allows me to blend art, storytelling, and technology seamlessly. 
I continuously optimize gameplay, engage in game planning, and actively acquire new programming skills. 
I believe that consistent learning and collaboration are key to success. 
I look forward to future challenges and sharing my game creations with you. 
If you have any questions or collaboration opportunities, 
please feel free to reach out to me. Thank you!
